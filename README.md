User inputs
# Sample 1
Input:
N = 3
arr[] = {-2, 4, 0}

5
Explanation:
We can change -2 to -1, 0 to -1 and 4 to 1.
So, a total of 5 steps are required
to update the elements such that
the product of the final array is 1. 
# Sample 2

Explanation:
Product of the array is already 1.
So, we don't need to change anything.
