# PROGRAM 2
# Given an array arr[] containing N integers. In one step, any element of the array can either be increased or decreased by one. Find minimum steps required such that the product of the array elements becomes 1.
User inputs
# Sample 1
Input:
N = 3
arr[] = {-2, 4, 0}
Output:
5
Explanation:
We can change -2 to -1, 0 to -1 and 4 to 1.
So, a total of 5 steps are required
to update the elements such that
the product of the final array is 1. 
# Sample 2
Input:
N = 3
arr[] = {-1, 1, -1} 
Output :
0
Explanation:
Product of the array is already 1.
So, we don't need to change anything.
